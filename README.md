# open-salesforce
This is a VS Code extension which opens chrome and auto-logins you into the Salesforce instance that your workspace is connected to by using the creds that are already present in the force.json file (auto-generated on the root of your workspace by SalesForce extensions).

## Beta Installing
1) Download [the packaged extension](https://github.com/dubyajaysmith/open-salesforce/blob/master/open-salesforce-0.0.1.vsix)
2) Load it in VS Code like below:

## State
This works by running a command to open chrome to a SalesForce url with creds as params to auto-login like this: 

```start chrome https://test.salesforce.com?un=<Project's User>&pw=<Project's Password minus Token>```

This assumes a 24 length token for now. I've used with several orgs so far and haven't found one with a 25 length token yet. Unfortunately, Salesforce security tokens can be 24 or 25 in length <b>and</b> are combined to your password in the force.json file auto-generated by SalesForce extensions. A work around could be to add `tokenLength: 25,` to the force.js file and while checking it; if that has a value of 25, do the subtraction with 25 else 24.
