# Open SalesForce
This is a VS Code extension which adds two commands to your Command Palette:

Open SalesForce : Opens chrome and auto-logins you in, placing you at the setup menu of the Salesforce instance that your workspace is connected to.

Open VisualForce : Opens the VisualForce page you currently have in your editor.

It can do this by using the credentials that are already present in the force.json file that is auto-generated on the root of your workspace by SalesForce extensions.

Salesforce security tokens can be 24 or 25 in length <b>and</b> are combined to your password in the force.json file so...

#### If this doesn't auto-log you in, it probably means your token is 25 in length
You can add your  `token: value`  if you know it OR you can put `25` in you force.json file:

`"token": "jYnNYYANFeuvYX8OueH3bN6Q1"`

OR

`"token": "25"`
